Designed the necessary hardware to interface the Spartan 3E FPGA with a 2x16 character LCD using Verilog. A message was displayed on the LCD using ASCII characters, which in this case, displayed "Hello Sean!". The FPGA controls the LCD via a 4-bit data interface by disabling the Intel StrataFlash memory in order to allow full read/write access to the LCD.
